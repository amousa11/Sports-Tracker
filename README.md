# Sports-Tracker

The ill named "Sports Tracker" is an NBA Statistics Tool that allows users to download up to date stats for all players and teams in an organized space. The tool is built using Java FX for the GUI and is the result of a few weeks work from (at the time) a high school student. 

## What You Can Do

The thickness of the bar could use some work, however.
